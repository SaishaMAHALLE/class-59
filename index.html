    <p> My hobby is drawing and painting. I really enjoy doing painting the most as I get to merge different colours! Once I made a painting of lord Buddha meditating in the green forest on a canvas. I also tried pencil shading of lord Ganesha. My drawing and painting teacher was Neha aunty. I started painting since I was 7 years old. I too tried still life paintings. It was too hard for me but still i tried my best! I attended drawing competitions and passed with good ranks in some of them. I really love abstract painting as I can use my own imagination over there!
